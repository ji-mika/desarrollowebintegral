To be fair cocaine is probably more useful than luciferase, that shit is almost fully placebo from what I remember.

Can't say I remember perfectly, but I do think luciferase helped against WCS, it didn't make anyone immune or anything tho, just meant you would last longer before turning into salt or legion

I don't know if Emil took Luciferase actually, I don't think he ever ended up fighting Legion in the end? Weiss definitely did though

Emil fought Legion in the Drama CD, he was kidnapped by Yura (Tyrann) to be used as a weapon. Still, he wasn't meant to be used to fight Legion, the Japanese Weapon Laboratory was meant to create weapons in order to increase their own military capabilities, using it against Legion would meant handing him to Hamelin, which is the faction Japan was the most cautelous on (they basically became the most powerful military entity in the world, and they could easily control the whole world if WCS ever ended during that era) basically there's a lot of political stuff surrounding organizations in the Drama CD

Hina and Yuzuki did sniff some, too. One turned into a self-destructive suicidal soldier, the other ended up a badass antisocial Legion leader

I'll be excited to get this joke someday. I only started my Nier journey for the very first time a couple of weeks ago.
